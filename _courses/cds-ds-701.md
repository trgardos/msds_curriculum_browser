This is a new course to be designed specifically for the MS DS program. Students will take this course in their first semester. The goal of the course is to give students exposure to, and practical experience in, formulating data science questions -- particularly learning how to ask good questions in a specific domain. The course will also cover methods of obtaining data and common methods of processing data from a practical standpoint. It will be organized around a semester-long group project in which students are organized into teams and engage with "clients" who bring data science questions from a particular domain. The course will include a formal presentation of results at the end of the semester.
