## course abstract

Application of stochastic process theory to design and analyze algorithms used in statistics and machine learning, especially Markov chain Monte Carlo and stochastic optimization methods. Emphasizes connecting theoretical results to practice through combination of proofs, numerical experiments, and expository writing. Effective Fall 2023, this course fulfills a single unit in each of the following BU Hub areas: Writing-Intensive Course, Creativity/Innovation.
