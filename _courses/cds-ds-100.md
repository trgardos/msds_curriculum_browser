"This course introduces students to three perspectives that are fundamental to  their ability to reason with data: critical thinking, inferential thinking, and  computational thinking. Through data modeling and visualization, students will  construct and communicate arguments that are rooted in data. The course expects  only basic computer knowledge and teaches concepts and skills in computer  programming (Python), linear regression, and statistical inference. The course  delves into dilemmas surrounding data analysis, such as balancing individual  privacy and social utility, and prepares students for the data driven world all  around us. Students with interests from politics to sports, finance to journalism,  entrepreneurship to smart cities, etc., can use the knowledge of data science they  gain in this class to enhance those interests. Not to mention a grounding for  students who want to pursue the field of data science itself. Effective Fall 2021, this course fulfills a single unit in each of the following BU Hub areas: Social Inquiry 1, Digital/Multimedia Expression, Research and Information Literacy.",
